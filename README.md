This is a project to demonstrate what I have learned so far about Python turtle. I will be updating this project and this description regularly.

This project creates a simple line that goes straight and turns left. I also ask the user to provide inputs of the color for the background and the pen. This is based on the permitted color names. (See link below.) In addition, I ask the user to put an input of the width of the pen.
